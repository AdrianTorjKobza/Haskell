Program created during the "Learning Haskell Programming - LinkedIn Learning" course.

The purpose of this simple program, is to check if a list of predefined words are part of a grid, by searching from left-to-right and right-to-left.

To also search from top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top, apply the "transpose" function against the grid.

The grid where we are going to search for the words:
[ "C________R_" , "SI________U" , "HASKELL____B" , "A__A_____S__Y" , "R___B___C" , "PHP____H__" , "S_LREP_" , "__I__M_Y__L" , "_L_E__T_O" , "_____HB" , "____O" , "___CN" ]

The words that we are going to search in the above grid:
[ "BASIC" , "COBOL" , "CSHARP" , "HASKELL" , "LISP" , "PERL" , "PHP" , "PYTHON" , "RUBY" , "SCHEME" ]
